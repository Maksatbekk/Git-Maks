Name of the project:

"Guess the number".

Purpose of the project:

"In this project I tried to grow the intellegency of people.
By using this project you can grow your thinking skills, your IQ.
Because this project is proposed to grow the thinking skills of people."
About the program:

"In this program you will be given a four-digit number which is taken randomly by java compiler.
And you should find the number. So, how you will guess the number?
If your guess is exactly same as randomly taken number, if it they are equal you will win, if your guess is not exactly correct 
but some digits are correct you will be given numbers. For each wrong placed digit you will be given -1 and for correct placed 
digit you will be given +1. So, if you guess the number correct program will print +4."

I hope this my first java program will be useful for people.
